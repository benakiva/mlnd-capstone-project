## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

Deep Learning is an emerging subfield of Machine Learning, which allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction (LeCun et al., 2015). Deep Learning has made major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in areas such as speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2011), image recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and natural language processing (Colbert et al., 2011). Deep Learning has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules (Ma et al., 2015), analysing particle accelerator data (Ciodaro et al., 2012), reconstructing brain circuits (Helmstaeder et al., 2013), and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease (Xiong et al., 2015).

Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in Deep Learning approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. Convolutional Neural Network (aka CNN or ConvNet) is the state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithm, which is often used in image recognition. It has achieved the highest accuracy in many image recognition challenges such as ImageNet,  MNIST and NORB databases. ConvNets were inspired by biological processes and are variations of multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing (LeCun et al., 1998).

According to recent statistical data published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, and the seventh overall, with an estimated 528,000 new cases in 2012. There were an estimated 266,000 deaths from cervical cancer worldwide in 2012, accounting for 7.5% of all female cancer deaths. Cervical cancer is so easy to prevent if caught in its pre-cancerous stage that every woman should have access to effective, life-saving treatment no matter where they live. Today, women worldwide in low-resource settings are benefiting from programs where cancer is identified and treated in a single visit. However, due in part to lacking expertise in the field, one of the greatest challenges of these cervical cancer screen and treat programs is determining the appropriate method of treatment which can vary depending on patients’ physiological differences.

Especially in rural parts of the world, many women at high risk for cervical cancer are receiving treatment that will not work for them due to the position of their cervix. This is a tragedy: health providers are able to identify high risk patients, but may not have the skills to reliably discern which treatment which will prevent cancer in these women. Even worse, applying the wrong treatment has a high cost. A treatment which works effectively for one woman may obscure future cancerous growth in another woman, greatly increasing health risks.

Currently, MobileODT offers a Quality Assurance workflow to support remote supervision which helps healthcare providers make better treatment decisions in rural settings. However, their workflow would be greatly improved given the ability to make real-time determinations about patients’ treatment eligibility based on cervix type.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
